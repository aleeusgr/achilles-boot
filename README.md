**Cardano Mobile Wallet on NixOS: A Secure and Sustainable Solution**

**Overview**

This project aims to provide a secure and user-friendly mobile wallet for Cardano, leveraging the power of NixOS to manage secrets and ensure the sustainable growth of the Cardano Ecosystem.

**Problem Statement*

Currently, Cardano developers who manage a significant flow of transactions are at risk of asset loss due to the lack of access to hardware wallets. With the ubiquity of smartphones, we can create a secure solution to manage secrets, promoting sustainable growth of Cardano.

**Goals**

* Research and develop a prototype for a mobile wallet system using NixOS
* Ensure the security and integrity of user assets
* Provide a user-friendly interface for Cardano transactions and management
* Leverage the NixOS ecosystem for simplicity, reliability, and security**

**Technology Stack**

* NixOS: A Linux distribution that allows for declarative configuration and ensures reproducibility and reliability
* [Mobile NixOS](https://github.com/mobile-nixos): A superset on top of NixOS Linux, Nixpkgs and Nix, aiming to abstract away the differences between mobile devices.
* Cardano APIs and SDKs: For interacting with the Cardano blockchain and performing transactions

**Getting Started**

To get started with this project, you'll need to:
* Familiarize yourself with NixOS and its configuration language
* Set up a development environment for mobile NixOS
